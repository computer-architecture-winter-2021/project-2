## Shortcomings
To my knowledge, there are no shortcomings in my code. Everything seems to be functional and correct.
However, I do not have extensive comments on the sub_big, mod_big, LLT, and mersenne_scan functions as I did not have enough time. The logic in these functions, however, matches that in the mersenne.c file and is easy to follow.
